      <p>Things I'm using at the moment to learn::</p>
      <ul>
          <li><a href="https://navoica.pl/">Navoica - begginner classes for Python in Polish prepared by Szczecin University</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/> Scratch - coding language for kids - you learn coding with blocks, no syntax needed to code. Good to learn the coding mindset</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://cybrary.it/> Cybrary - entry level courses from different fields of IT</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p> Also remember to take it slow, cause the task might overwhelm you</p>
      
      <ol>
          <li>Take it slow</li>
          <li>Recall what you've learned EVERYDAY - 10 mins</li>
          <li>Summarize and recall what you already know. Formulate it and write down.</li>
          <li>You will be frustrated many times - like me when I need to move around on GitHub. Not very intuitive for a begginner</li>
      </ol>
